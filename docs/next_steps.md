2. Enhance type definitions and validation
3. Improve error handling and reporting
4. Finish the local development environment

### Phase 2: Real-World Examples (2-3 Weeks)

Implement practical examples to demonstrate real-world usage:

1. Build the GraphQL MCP server implementation
2. Create the Elasticsearch MCP server
3. Develop a database access MCP server
4. Document each implementation thoroughly

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (3-4 Weeks)

Add advanced features and optimizations:

1. Implement WebSocket transport
2. Add caching mechanisms
3. Create advanced security controls
4. Optimize for performance and cold start

### Phase 4: Enterprise Readiness (4+ Weeks)

   - Add proper support for notifications
   - Implement server capabilities advertisement
   - Improve error handling and reporting

3. **Expanding Test Suite**
   - Create unit tests for core components
   - Build integration tests for GraphQL implementation
   - Add protocol compliance tests
   - Implement performance tests

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Update architectural documentation with latest insights
   - Create detailed GraphQL implementation guide
   - Add more examples of tool implementation patterns
   - Update deployment documentation

## Resources Needed

- **AWS Resources**:
  - Lambda and API Gateway access
  - GraphQL API endpoint for testing
  - Elasticsearch instance for implementation
  - IAM permissions for deployment

- **Development Resources**:
  - GraphQL client libraries
  - Elasticsearch client libraries
