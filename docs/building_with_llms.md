# Building Lambda-MCP Servers with LLMs

This guide shows how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude to help build custom Lambda-MCP servers efficiently.

## Preparing Documentation for LLMs

When working with an LLM to develop Lambda-MCP servers, provide the following documentation:

1. **MCP Protocol Documentation**:
   - The full MCP specification from https://modelcontextprotocol.io/
   - Key concepts like transport layers, message formats, and tool definitions

2. **Lambda-MCP Documentation**:
   - The architectural design document
   - Implementation examples
   - Security considerations

3. **AWS Lambda Documentation**:
   - Basic Lambda concepts
   - API Gateway integration
   - Event/response structures

## Template for Describing Your Server to an LLM

```
I want to build a Lambda-MCP server that:

1. Purpose:
   - [Describe the main purpose of your server]

2. Data Sources:
   - [List the data sources or APIs it will connect to]

3. Tools to Implement:
   - [List specific tools with their functionality]

4. Security Requirements:
   - [Specify authentication or security measures]

5. Additional Features:
   - [Any other relevant features]
```

## Example Development Workflow with Claude

### Step 1: Describe Your Server

```
I want to build a Lambda-MCP server using the Lambda-MCP library that connects to a GraphQL API for our product catalog. The server should provide tools to:
1. Search products by name, category, or attributes
2. Get detailed product information
3. Check product inventory levels

The GraphQL API requires authentication via an API key.
```

### Step 2: Implementation Planning

Ask Claude to help plan the implementation:

```
How should I structure the implementation of this GraphQL MCP server? What components will I need to create?
```

### Step 3: Code Generation

Request code for specific components:

```
Can you write the code for the GraphQL search tool implementation, including parameter validation and error handling?
```

### Step 4: Integration

Ask for help integrating the tools with the Lambda-MCP framework:

```
How do I register these tools with the Lambda-MCP server and create the Lambda handler?
```

### Step 5: Deployment Configuration

Request CDK code for deployment:

```
Can you provide the AWS CDK stack for deploying this GraphQL MCP server?
```

## Best Practices

1. **Incremental Development**:
   - Start with a single tool and get it working
   - Add more tools and features incrementally
   - Test each addition before moving on

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Ask LLMs to include robust error handling
   - Ensure each tool validates inputs properly
   - Add logging for debugging

3. **Security Focus**:
   - Have LLMs implement proper authentication
   - Add input validation and sanitization
   - Implement appropriate permissions

4. **Testing**:
   - Use the local development server for testing
   - Create sample requests for each tool
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

5. **Documentation**:
   - Ask LLMs to document each tool clearly
   - Include example requests/responses
   - Document any limitations or edge cases

## Iterative Improvement

LLMs excel at refactoring and improving code. Use prompts like:

- "Can you optimize this code for better performance?"
- "How can I make this error handling more robust?"
- "Can you refactor this to be more maintainable?"

## Example Tools to Build

The Lambda-MCP framework is ideal for building these types of tools:

1. **Database Connectors**:
   - SQL query tools
   - NoSQL database access
   - Data lake exploration

2. **API Integrations**:
   - REST API clients
   - GraphQL query tools
   - SOAP service connectors

3. **Content Processing**:
   - Document search and retrieval
   - Media metadata extraction
   - Content categorization

4. **Enterprise System Access**:
   - CRM data access
   - ERP system integration
   - Identity management

## Testing with the MCP Inspector

After developing your server with the help of an LLM:

1. Use the local development tools to test
2. Connect to Claude Desktop or other MCP clients
3. Try the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/tutorials/inspector) for debugging
4. Iterate based on real-world usage
